# UnityExtras
 
Commands to push HDAs from your working Houdini project to a selected Unity Project folder. 

Two commands will be added to the context menu of HDAs.

1. "**Save Node Type and Push to Unity**"
2. "**Set Unity project HDA folder**"


A global variable **UNITY_PROJECT_HDA_PATH** will be saved in your scene file. You can change this folder via the command "**Set Unity project HDA folder**"

 "**Save Node Type and Push to Unity**" will save node type and then copy it to your Unity project folder.

This saves you the hassle of manual copying your HDAs especially if you keep your production and devopment HDAs folders separate.
